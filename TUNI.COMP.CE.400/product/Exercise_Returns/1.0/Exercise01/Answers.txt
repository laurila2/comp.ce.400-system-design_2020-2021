INCLUDE ANSWERS IN HERE

1. What is the focus of the exercise project (=all exercises)? Why?
Hint: Read the exercise project summary from Moodle
Hint 2: Implementing a video encoder is NOT the focus of the exercises.
 Focus is to learn to use open source components, to do a real project with
 multiple tools and to do model based system design flow.


*** PART ONE ***

Some of the questions may involve examining the txt-files generated while encoding.

2. How much time did the encoding take? Look at the "Total CPU time".

	QP 50: 68.340 s
	GROUP QP: 123.506 s

3. How many frames were encoded per second (FPS)?

	QP 50: 1.72
	GROUP QP: 0.96

4. How did decreasing the quantization value affect perceived quality of the video output?
 Better

5. How did decreasing the quantization value affect size of the video output file?
 File size was 10x of the original.

7. What was average PSNR?

	QP 50: 29.5551 31.4598 35.8015
	GROUP QP: 41.4892 41.2202 42.4295

8. What was the data compression ratio of encoding using your assigned quantization value?
Data compression ratio is defined as (size of the video input file)/(size of the video output file).

	QP 50: 434.45
	GROUP QP: 41.57

*** PART TWO ***

9. What was average PSNR of the profiling run?
 AVG PSNR: 41.4892 41.2202 42.4295

10. What does parameter -pg do in GCC? How it affects the resulting executable and its execution?
 Generate extra code to write profile information suitable for the analysis program gprof (for -pg).

11. Which three (3) functions use most time in Kvazaar? Answer based on the time used by functions
alone, not by the functions they call.

 kvz_angular_pred_generic,     44.37%
 partial_butterfly_32_generic, 9.69%
 kvz_quant_generic,	       7.51%

12. Why it is better to look at percentages rather than absolute time like seconds or milliseconds while
using a profiling tool (like gprof)?
 It's easier to see what is taking processor time, absolute time might be wrong anyway.

13. Which function would you choose for hardware acceleration? If there are multiple good candidates, choose one.
 kvz_angular_pred_generic

14. What does that function do? Why do you think it's a good candidate for hardware acceleration?
Mention at least two reasons.
Hint: Look at the source code at Kactus2 location TUNI.fi->ip.sw->Kvazaar->0.7.2->src 
 Function generates angular predictions. Lot of calls --> Small time save might increase performance a lot.
 Can be parallelized to some amount of cores.

15. How are you feeling? What was hard? What was easy?
 Tasks were pretty easy, but it's hard to understand whats going on.

16. Fill the used hours below, including answering questions and any downtime:
ANSWER THE HOURS AS IF YOU WERE PAID FOR IT (we will not pay you, though)

	GROUP MEMBER 1: 252844, 4h
	GROUP MEMBER 2: 274301, 4h
