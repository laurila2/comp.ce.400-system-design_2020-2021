INCLUDE ANSWERS IN HERE

1. Did you get similar results simulating Kvazaar on ARM? What was the simulated FPS for Kvazaar on ARM?
	Yes, 0.07

2. What were your values for delay_c, search_intra_rough_percentage_c, rest_percentage_c?
	delay_c = 17000, search_intra_rough_percentage_c = 0.59, rest_percentage_c = 0.41

3. What was the simulated FPS of the HW-accelerated version?
	0.17

4. How was the computation time/delay added to the simulation on both ARM simulation and HW-accelerated simulation? What function/s, variable/s, and calculations are used?
	search_delay((int)(cu_width*delay_c*rest_percentage_c)) for HW and SW exploration, 
	search_intra_rough_delay((int)(width*delay_c*search_intra_rough_percentage_c)) for SW exploration,
	intra_rough_search_time, rest_of_the_encoder_time, transfer_time keep track of spent time in simulation

5. Do you think the computation time/delay is calculated accurately enough?
	Yes

6. How do we know the improvement we got with the HW accelerator is correct?
	We trust that calculations are correct, afterwards we can compare to real HW results

7. How many data transfers happened and how much data was sent and read while simulating the HW-accelerated version?

8. What percentages did you get for search_intra_rough/(HW-accelerator and transfers) and for the rest of the encoder, simulating Kvazaar on ARM and simulating the HW-accelerated version?
	ARM simulation:
		search_intra_rough 0.59
		rest of the encoder 0.41
	HW accelerated simulation
		transfers 0.01
		search_intra_rough 0.01
		rest of the encoder 0.98

9. What does using wait() in delay_ns() cause?
	Increases simulation time

10. By looking at the two different waveforms, what kind of problems not using wait() causes?
	Simulation time does not represent actual time in HW

11. What were your values for ARM_USED_CORES, arm_overclock_mhz_c, NUMBER_OF_ACCS and FPGA_FREQ_MHZ that achieved full HD real time encoding?
	ARM_USED_CORES = 95
	arm_overclock_mhz_c = 1500
	NUMBER_OF_ACCS = 80
	FPGA_FREQ_MHZ = 350

12. What was hard? What was easy?
	Following instructions was easy, hard was figuring out if our results were realistic
