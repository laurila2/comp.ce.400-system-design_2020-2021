1. Obviously, the blinker application of the exercise is implementable with hardware.
What are the pros and cons of implementing it with hardware? Mention at least two pros and one con.
	Pro: Possibly faster execution, it is more satisfying to interact with HW
	Con: Takes a lot more time to implement

2. Are the LEDs active low or high? When you press a button, does it produce one or zero?
	LEDs active low, pressing a button produces zero

3. You had to generate addresses for components in Qsys. Why?
	Default addresses were same for components, they need to be different

4. As you saw in the sources codes and the system designs in Kactus2,
the application is separated from hardware with a HAL component. Why?
	It provides device-independent implementations for standard functions

5. The HAL layer maps a physical memory region to virtual memory before using it.
Why it cannot use physical memory directly?
	Only the OS kernel can access physical memory directly

6. When you tried to execute the second build of the application on PC, it failed. Why? Mention at least two reasons.
	HAL is not compatible with the VM, Binary format is made for VEEK-system, it is incompatible with VM

7. Memory and connections were used for communication between hardware and software. How?
	Buttons and LEDs were mapped to memory and read to software through LWH2F bridge

8. What was hard? What was easy?
	Following instructions was easy
